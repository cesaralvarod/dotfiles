Now I'm using Arch Linux. I love Linux.

On Arh Linux I use i3 as Window Manager, I also tried bspwm and I tried to config that (I don't like it because I use 2 monitors and it was very complicated to set up)

## All tools that I use

- alacritty
- bspwm
- dunst
- i3
- nautilus
- nvim
- polybar
- ranger
- rofi
- sxhkd

## An aditional custom file

You can see **webdevicons.vim**, that's a custom file from vim's pluggin **webdevicons**. You can put that in **$HOME/.vimrc/plugged/webdevicons/**

It's all :)
